## GrimoireLab Release Tools 0.3.0 - (2020-10-28)

**New features:**

 * Validate content before saving with the changelog tool (#17)\
   When the editor opens with changelog, the user can make mistakes and
   produce an invalid entry file. This would break the workflow and
   produce error while doing semverup. This feature validates the format
   of the yml file and gives info about the errors, if any. This gives an
   option to edit the file incase it if has any mistakes, so you need not
   create a new entry.
